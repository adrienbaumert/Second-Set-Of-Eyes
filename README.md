# Second-Set-Of-Eyes

## Description

**Second-Set-Of-Eyes** is an open-source framework designed to assist blind and vision-impaired individuals in navigating their surroundings. With a core mission to empower developers, this framework can be leveraged to create robust applications or software tailored for the blind and vision-impaired community.

At its core, the functionality is simple so that no issues arrise with vision impared use: double-tap and it captures an image using `cv2`. This image is then processed through Salesforce's image captioning API, and the resulting description is made audible using Google's Text-to-Speech.

Emphasizing its open-source nature, Developers are invited to contribute, adapt, and implement this framework in diverse applications, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in accessibility technology.
